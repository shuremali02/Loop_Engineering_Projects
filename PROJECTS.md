# Loop Engineering — All 12 Projects (verbatim)

Master index. Har project ka apna folder + `.claude/skills/` hai; yahan sirf
saari verbatim task descriptions ek jagah rakhi hain taake pura course ek
file mein dikhe.

The course has **12 real deliverables total**, not 8: the 8 "Practice
projects" (Concepts 1-6) below, plus 4 more in the "Appendix: Routines,
end to end" — 3 hands-on drills (Projects 9-11) that use real **Claude
Code cloud Routines** (`claude.ai/code/routines`), and a second capstone
(Project 12, "the dreaming loop") that reads a week of `progress.md` logs
from Project 3 or 8 and proposes rule changes as a PR.

---

## Project 1 — Watch Loop
Folder: `project-1-watch-loop/`

**Difficulty:** easy · **Uses:** Concept 4 (in-session loop)

**Build.** Start a long task in your repo (for example, a script that
sleeps for a while and then writes a file). Set up an in-session loop that
checks every minute whether the task has finished, and tells you the
moment it has.

**Done when** the loop notices the task finished, says so once, and you
can stop it cleanly, and you never sat watching the terminal.

---

## Project 2 — Tests Pass
Folder: `project-2-tests-pass/`

**Difficulty:** easy to medium · **Uses:** Concept 5 (conditional loop),
Concept 11 (maker-checker)

**Build.** Put 2 or 3 small failing tests in your repo. Build a loop that
keeps working until the tests pass, but let a command (the test runner),
not the agent, decide when it is done. Cap it at, say, 6 tries.

**Done when** the loop stops because the tests actually passed, not
because it hit the cap. If it keeps hitting the cap, your stop condition
or your prompt needs work. That is the lesson.

---

## Project 3 — Morning Brief
Folder: `project-3-morning-brief/`

**Difficulty:** medium · **Uses:** Concept 6 (unattended schedule),
Concept 12 (the spine)

**Build.** Make a scheduled loop that runs once, reads a `progress.md`,
gathers something simple from the repo (open TODO comments, or the last
day's commits), writes a short summary, and updates `progress.md` with
what it found and the date.

**Done when** you run it twice and the second run clearly builds on the
first, meaning it does not repeat what it already recorded. That proves
your spine works. If the second run starts from nothing, your loop has
no memory yet.

---

## Project 4 — Fix Loop
Folder: `project-4-fix-loop/`

**Difficulty:** medium to hard · **Uses:** Concept 8 (worktree),
Concept 9 (skill), Concept 11 (maker-checker)

**Build.** A smaller version of the Part 5 loop. Write a short skill with
your fix steps, and a reviewer agent that replies PASS or FAIL. Take one
real bug, have the implementer draft a fix in its own checkout (worktree
or branch), and let the reviewer grade it. Open a PR only on PASS.

**Done when** two things are both true: a good fix gets a PASS and a PR,
and a deliberately bad fix you plant gets a FAIL with reasons. If the
reviewer passes the bad fix, your checker is too soft, so tighten it. A
checker that approves everything is no checker.

---

## Project 5 — Codify the Body
Folder: `project-5-codify-body/`

**Difficulty:** medium to hard · **Uses:** the dynamic-workflows
interlude, Concepts 8 and 11

**Build.** Take the fix loop you built in Project 4 and codify its body.
On the Claude Code approach, describe it in plain words: "use a workflow
to draft fixes for these three issues in parallel worktrees, and have a
reviewer grade each one." Let the runtime write and run the script. When
a run does what you want, save it from the `/workflows` view as a
`/command`. On the OpenCode approach, write the same thing as a shell
script: a for loop over the candidates, `&`/`wait` for the fan-out, and
the reviewer's exit code as the checker. Run it twice.

**Done when** two things are true. First, one command (or one script)
runs the whole draft-and-review body, meaning several candidates,
isolated checkouts, and a verdict for each, with no step-by-step
prompting from you. Second, you have proved the interlude's warning on
your own machine: start a fresh session (or a fresh shell) and confirm
the workflow remembers nothing from its last run. Then name what it
would need to become a loop: a heartbeat to fire it, and a progress file
its agents write. If you can name those two, you understand the
difference between an engine and a loop. (Dynamic workflows are a
research preview, so where this project and the live docs disagree, the
docs win.)

## Project 6 — Doorbell Loop
Folder: `project-6-doorbell-loop/`

**Difficulty:** medium · **Uses:** Concept 7 (event-driven),
Concept 10 (connectors)

**Build.** Make your throwaway repo review its own pull requests. On the
OpenCode approach, run `opencode github install` and accept the workflow
it generates. On the Claude Code approach, create a Routine with a
GitHub pull-request trigger (the appendix walks through the filters).
Then open a PR that contains one planted bug, such as an off-by-one or a
deleted null check, and wait.

**Done when** the PR gets a review you never asked for, and the review
flags the planted bug. If the review misses it, tighten the prompt and
push again. The push fires the loop once more through the `synchronize`
event, and that re-fire is the event heartbeat working. With Projects 1
to 3, this completes all four heartbeats: in-session, conditional,
scheduled, and event-driven.

---

## Project 7 — Break It On Purpose
Folder: `project-7-break-it-on-purpose/`

**Difficulty:** medium · **Uses:** Observability, Concept 13 (cost),
Concept 14

**Build.** Take your Project 3 loop. First, measure one beat: note
roughly how many tokens a run reads and writes, and multiply by your
cadence to get a monthly cost, which is Concept 13's math on your own
loop. Then sabotage it: point the prompt at a file that does not exist,
or give it a success condition it can never meet (with a limit set). Let
it fire on schedule and fail. Now diagnose the failure using only what
the loop left behind, meaning the log line and `progress.md`, without
replaying the full run.

**Done when** three things are true. You can say what failed, and when,
from the spine alone. The loop left a clear "needs a human" note instead
of failing silently. And you know your loop's monthly cost at its
current cadence. If it failed silently, fix that before anything else by
adding the log line. You are rehearsing the overnight failure now, while
it is cheap and you are watching.

---

## Project 8 — Your Own Daily Loop (Capstone)
Folder: `project-8-your-own-daily-loop/`

**Difficulty:** capstone · **Uses:** all six parts

**Build.** Pick one real, boring, recurring chore in a project you
actually work on: a dependency audit, a docs-freshness check, a
changelog draft, a lint sweep. Build the full loop: heartbeat, worktree,
skill, maker-checker, connector, and the spine. Add budget guards. Let
it run.

**Done when** it has run unattended for a week and you trust what it
ships because you read it, not because you stopped reading. Then answer
Concept 15 honestly: did your understanding of the project keep up with
what the loop changed? If not, slow the loop down until it does. (When
it fails overnight, and it will, work through "When an unattended loop
fails" before you blame the model.)

---

## Project 9 — Rehearse a Routine for Free
Folder: `project-9-rehearse-a-routine/`

**Difficulty:** easy (20-30 min) · **Uses:** A1, A3 (one-off schedules),
A5 (reading runs)

**Build.** In a throwaway repo, create a routine whose prompt does one
small, checkable thing, for example summarizing yesterday's commits onto
a `claude/summary` branch. Do not put it on a repeating schedule. Fire it
with a one-off run (`/schedule tomorrow at 9am, …` or *Run now*) and read
the full transcript, not the status column. Then change the prompt so
the task must fail, by having it read a file that does not exist, and
fire it once more.

**Done when** you have seen two green runs: one whose transcript shows
success, and one whose transcript shows failure. You should be able to
say, in one sentence, why the status column could not tell them apart.
That sentence is the A5 lesson: green means the session ended without an
infrastructure error, nothing more.

---

## Project 10 — The Secrets Drill
Folder: `project-10-secrets-drill/`

**Difficulty:** easy to medium (30-45 min) · **Uses:** A4 (secrets), A2
(the environment)

**Build.** Write a prompt that needs one secret. A dummy token is fine,
because the drill is about where the value lives, not what it unlocks.
First run: put the token in a gitignored `.env` file and fire the
routine. Watch it fail to find the value, and read the transcript to see
what Claude tried instead. Second run: move the token into the
environment-variables panel, and add the one prompt line the appendix
recommends: "credentials are available as environment variables; do not
look for a `.env` file."

**Done when** the second run reads the token from the environment, and
you can explain the mechanical reason the first run could not: gitignored
files never reach GitHub, so the fresh cloud clone never contains them.

---

## Project 11 — Build the Two-Routine Gate
Folder: `project-11-two-routine-gate/`

**Difficulty:** medium to hard (1-2 hrs) · **Uses:** A3 (the API
trigger), A4 (the gate), A6 (the checklist)

**Build.** Routine A, on a one-off schedule, drafts something reviewable:
a `claude/` branch, or a short summary posted through a connector.
Routine B has an API trigger and performs one small follow-up action.
Store B's bearer token the moment it is shown, because it is shown once.
Review A's draft yourself. Then approve it by firing B with the `curl`
call from A3.

**Done when** three things are true: B ran only because you fired it,
B's transcript shows the action actually happened, and you have run the
A6 checklist over both routines, with connectors pruned, unrestricted
pushes off, and a state file chosen. This is the human gate from Part 5,
and now you have built it out of real parts.

---

## Project 12 — Build a Dreaming Loop (Second Capstone)
Folder: `project-12-dreaming-loop/`

**Difficulty:** capstone (2-3 hrs) · **Uses:** Concept 12 (spine and
improvement loop), Concept 11 (maker-checker), Concept 6 (schedule),
Part 5 (human gate)

**Build.** You need a loop that has already run for a week and left
dated entries in `progress.md` (Project 3 or Project 8 gives you one).
Now build a second loop over it. On a weekly schedule, it reads all log
entries since the date in its own `dreaming-state.md`, looks for any
failure or correction that appears more than once, and drafts the
smallest rules-file or skill change that would prevent it, as a PR on a
`claude/` branch, never a direct commit. The PR description must cite
its evidence: which runs, how often, and why this line stops it. Have it
also propose one deletion: a rule no recent run needed. Finish by
updating `dreaming-state.md`.

**Done when** three things are true. The PR's proposed change traces to
real, cited log entries, not a plausible-sounding guess. A deliberately
planted repeated failure in the logs (add one by hand) gets caught and
turned into a proposal. And nothing changed in your rules file without
you merging it. If the loop proposes changes with no evidence attached,
tighten the prompt: an improvement loop that guesses is worse than no
improvement loop, because its guesses steer every future run.
